## The ideas:
The ideas here are big thing, some of them will require *some* effort to do.

- Replace `VideoConverter.js` with `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg`.
- Add Video player and Video API using `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg`
## Rewrites
- Rewrite Scripting API.
- Rewrite almost all of the stuff.
- Port to CoffeeScript.
- Port UI to *some other lib* that isn't jQuery.
