# Markers in NB Studio
Since this codebase is painfully hard to use, markers are used to represent where we shouldn't go!

### Current Markers
| File Name |                                             Use Case                                            |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `DEADEND` | The included directory contains deprecated/abandoned libraries that should and will be changed. |
|  `NOWAY`  |                 Something(s) is(are) broken in this directory, please fix ASAP!                 |
|  `UNUSED` |  Not used, *"deleted"* (as in the files are commented.) and mostly ignored and/or removed soon. |
|   `NOPE`  |                                   Some mix of the last three.                                   |
