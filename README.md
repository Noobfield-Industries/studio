NB Studio is a browser-based hybrid animation/coding environment for making interactive things for the web, heavily inspired by similar tools such as Flash, HyperCard[^2], and Scratch[^1]. It was developed in response to a growing need for such a tool for the modern web. NB Studio is currently live at <!--[my github pages](https://internetastronaut.github.io/web-animate/)--> *soonâ„¢*, come check it out sometime!

### Footnotes
[^1]: Scratch is way more modern *now* than in the era of legacy Wick Editor. Scratch 2 (the version referenced as not for the modern web) was made for Flash Player, a legacy retired piece of software relevant from 1995-2015ish.
[^2]: HyperCard was a popular software for learning programming with GUI Apple computers (Lisa, Macintosh, any platform running OS).
