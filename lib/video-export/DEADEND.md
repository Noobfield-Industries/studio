# Dead end marker!
When reffering to this directory, please remember to make a issue or anything to stop the use of this library.

## Why?
The library here, `videoconverter.js`, has been largely unmaintaned for most of the modern years, we should change to the described possible changes:
- use `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg`
- move away from `/lib` in general
